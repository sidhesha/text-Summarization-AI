"The previous edition of the tournament, held in 2018, followed the ODI format and India was able to bag the title by beating Bangladesh in the finals. Meanwhile this year, a total of 13 games will be played in the tournament, which would be helpful for the selectors to have a look at their combinations for the T20 World Cup 2022 in Australua. Initially, the tournament was set to be held in Sri Lanka, however, due to the economical situation in the country, the Asia Cup 2022 was moved to UAE."
"Even as England and India will lock horns in the rescheduled fifth and final Test at Edgbaston in Birmingham, the visitors’ T20I squad will face Derbyshire in a T20 warm-up game. This is not the first time that India’s two separate squads will be in action at the same time. The squad that faced Ireland will also be in action during the first warm-up game on Friday. The match is set to be played at the County Ground in Derby and will commence at 11.30 PM IST."
"The newly debuted franchise steamrolled the competition during the league phase last year and were the team to beat heading into the playoffs. The team was expected to stutter in the knockout stages, given their relative inexperience in the competition. However, a blend of youth and experience in the camp did the unthinkable by clinching the title in their maiden season."
"The franchise is expected to refrain from making too many changes to the winning squad and will likely retain the core group of players that propelled them to glory last year. Hardik Pandya will likely have the services of young opening batter Shubman Gill, who had a prolific season with the bat last time around. Globetrotting all-rounder Rashid Khan will be at the heart of the Gujrat bowling line-up with the swashbuckling Protean David Miller providing strength to the batting order."
